# Game-of-Life-VBA
A fully featured VBA - Excel version of Conway's Game of Life

I implemented Game of Life in Excel via VBA, adding these features:
 - Rule Editor: by default it uses Conway's rules for replication of cells, but you can easily change them however you want, experimenting with different types of celullar automata.
 - circular edges: The board is actually infinite. Regardless of the set size of the board, cells wrap around the edges and continue life.
 - random cell insertion (custom number) + circle insertion  
 - glider insertion
 - custom size of the board and number of rounds
 - 3 eye pleasing color schemes
